# UTA Bootcamp Challenge NUMBER

In this homework assignment from the University of Texas-Austin Bootcamp we were asked to re-factor starter code to get a PWA functioning for the JATE app.

## Description

The purpose of this exercise was to practice setting up the packages.json and javascript files in order to correctly configure the IndexedDB in the browser to store information for offline operation and quicker operation generally.

## Installation

If installing this from the back end, you will need to install Node.js. Then from the root folder run

`npm i`

Then run 

`npm install`

This second command will install the backend server and the frontend framework.


## Usage

Users can write their own code in the browser. However, the main purpose of this project is to demonstrate that the infomration is stored on a single page in the browser. To appreciate this, open the heroku deployment: https://inexed-db-jate.herokuapp.com/

Then navigate into the developer tools and turn off the internet connection to see the app function completely offline.

You can also install the JATE app as a PWA.
